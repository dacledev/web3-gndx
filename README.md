This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Description 
The main objective of this project is learn the basics about web3 following the video tutorial of MiduDev. Maybe this is a little step to reach an important point in my career as developer. 


## Guideline

First step is use a wallet system tool for developing in ethereum -> [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
